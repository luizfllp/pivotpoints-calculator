#Pivot Points Calculator

I have written this calculator based on an [article](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/pivot-points/#:~:text=The%20pivot%20point%20is%20then,prices%20and%20the%20pivot%20point.) about  Pivot Points and day trade.

My other purpose of this calculator is to practice a little bit of  [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) and [Promise.all](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all)

Hope this may help someone anywhere.
